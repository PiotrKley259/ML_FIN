      "Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In developing these estimates and assumptions, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving management across the organization including finance, sales, project management, quality, legal and tax, as well as outside advisors such as consultants, engineers, lawyers and actuaries. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue recognition - We recognize revenue when title has transferred, except within our Architectural Services segment, which enters into fixed-price installation contracts. The contracts clearly specify the enforceable rights of the parties, the consideration and the terms of settlement, and both parties can be expected to satisfy all obligations under the contract. These contracts are typically performed over a 12- to 18-month timeframe, and we record revenue for these contracts on a percentage-of-completion basis as we are able to reasonably estimate total contract revenue and total contract costs. We compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract, and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period. Contract costs include materials, labor and other direct costs related to contract performance. We believe utilizing the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition provides the greatest degree of accuracy in measuring revenue throughout the contract period. Provisions are established for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined. Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other items are included in contract revenue only upon customer approval. Recogizing revenue under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting requires significant estimates, including total costs and the percentage complete on the contract, as well as any potential losses or contract overruns. During fiscal 2016 , approximately 25 percent of our consolidated sales were recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis.\n",

      "Goodwill impairment - We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually at our year-end, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Step one of the process compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill impairment is not indicated. We have seven business units that each represent a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on our analysis, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, goodwill impairment was not indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "We base our determination of fair value on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments about projections of future performance.  Assumptions about future revenues and expenses, capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on the annual operating plan and long-term business plan for each business unit. These plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated future economic conditions and growth expectations for the industries and end markets in which we participate. Growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit. Revenues and operating profit beyond our internal planning period are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate of 3.0%. The discount rate assumption for each reporting unit takes into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of our business and our weighted-average cost of capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties - We are subject to claims associated with our products and services, principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving the performance or aesthetics of our architectural products and services. The time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved, either by dismissal, negotiation, settlement or litigation, can be several years. While we maintain product liability insurance, the insurance policies include significant self-retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles. In addition, certain claims could be determined to be uninsured. We reserve estimated exposures on known claims, as well as on a portion of anticipated claims for product warranty and rework costs based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-insurance reserves - We obtain commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability, employment practices, workers' compensation, automobile liability, architect's and engineer's errors and omissions risk, product rework and other miscellaneous coverages. A substantial portion of this risk is retained on a self-insured basis through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. We establish a reserve for estimated ultimate losses on reported claims and those incurred but not yet reported utilizing actuarial projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Income taxes - We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.\n"
